    question: 'How do React Server Components (RSC) differ from traditional Client-Side Rendering and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with hydration?',
    category: 'frontend',
    difficulty: 'Senior',
    companyTags: ['Meta', 'Vercel', 'Uber'],
    techStack: ['React 19', 'Next.js App Router', 'Hydration', 'Streaming'],
    idealAnswer: `React Server Components (RSC) execute exclusively on the server and never bundle their code into the client JavaScript bundle. Unlike traditional SSR (which produces static HTML that still requires the entire component tree to hydrate on the client with full bundle downloads), RSCs stream a specialized JSON-like wire format (RSC payload) containing rendered JSX and serialized props.

Key architectural benefits:
1. Zero client-side bundle impact: Heavy server libraries (markdown parsers, database clients, crypto utilities) stay 100% on the server.
2. Direct backend resource access: RSCs can directly query databases, internal microservices, and file systems without client API hops.
3. Selective hydration: Client Components ('use client') interleave seamlessly inside RSCs as "leaf" or "wrapper" nodes, hydrating independently without blocking the entire page.`,

    idealAnswer: `The Critical Rendering Path encompasses the sequence of steps the browser takes to convert HTML, CSS, and JS into visible pixels: DOM parsing -> CSSOM creation -> Render Tree creation -> Layout (Reflow) -> Paint -> Compositing.

Core Web Vitals quantify user experience:
1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP, target < 2.5s): Measures perceived loading speed of the main viewport element. Optimized via resource preloading (rel="preload"), image compression (WebP/AVIF), CDN edge caching, and server-side rendering without render-blocking CSS/JS.
2. Interaction to Next Paint (INP, target < 200ms): Replaced FID. Measures page responsiveness across all user clicks, taps, and keypresses. Optimized by breaking long tasks (>50ms) with requestIdleCallback or scheduler.yield(), offloading CPU-heavy operations to Web Workers, and minimizing main thread JavaScript execution.
3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS, target < 0.1): Quantifies visual stability. Optimized by always declaring explicit width/height or aspect-ratio on images/videos, reserving space for dynamic ad banners, and using font-display: optional or size-adjust to prevent FOUT/FOIT.`,

    difficulty: 'Mid-Level',
    companyTags: ['Netflix', 'Stripe', 'Airbnb'],
    techStack: ['JavaScript Core', 'Event Loop', 'V8 Engine', 'Async'],
    idealAnswer: `The JavaScript runtime is single-threaded and coordinates execution through a continuous Event Loop with distinct priority queues:

1. Call Stack: Synchronous execution executes first until empty.
2. Microtask Queue (highest async priority): Includes Promise.then/catch/finally, MutationObserver callbacks, and queueMicrotask(). The runtime drains the ENTIRE microtask queue (including microtasks queued by other microtasks) before processing the next macrotask or rendering a frame.
3. Rendering Pipeline: Prior to screen refresh (~16.6ms at 60Hz), the browser executes requestAnimationFrame (rAF) callbacks, calculates CSSOM recals, and runs layout/paint.
4. Macrotask (Task) Queue: Includes setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, and I/O callbacks. The event loop picks exactly ONE macrotask, executes it, drains all microtasks, checks if a frame should be rendered, and repeats.`,

    idealAnswer: `Idempotency ensures that submitting identical API requests multiple times produces the exact same outcome as a single request without side effects like double billing.

Production Architecture:
1. Idempotency Key Header: The client generates a unique UUID (v4) sent via 'Idempotency-Key'.
2. Atomic Lock & Record:
   - On request ingress, query an Idempotency Store (Redis or PostgreSQL table) inside a distributed lock (e.g. Redlock or SELECT ... FOR UPDATE).
   - If key does not exist: Insert record with status 'PROCESSING', request hash (to detect payload tampering), and TTL (e.g., 24 hours).
   - If key exists with status 'PROCESSING': Return HTTP 409 Conflict or hold connection until lock releases, preventing concurrent race conditions.
   - If key exists with status 'COMPLETED': Return the previously cached HTTP response (status code, headers, and body) immediately without hitting the payment gateway.
3. Payload Tampering Validation: Hash the request body (SHA-256) and verify it matches the stored hash; if the client changed the amount or currency under the same key, return HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity.

    question: 'Compare Apache Kafka with RabbitMQ. What are their architectural differences, message delivery guarantees, and optimal use cases?',
    category: 'backend',
    difficulty: 'Staff / Architect',
    companyTags: ['LinkedIn', 'Uber', 'Cloudflare'],
    techStack: ['Kafka', 'RabbitMQ', 'Event-Driven', 'Message Queues'],
    idealAnswer: `While both are messaging platforms, their foundational architectures solve fundamentally different problem domains:

1. Storage vs Ephemeral Queue:
   - Kafka: Distributed, append-only partitioned commit log. Messages are persisted to disk and retained according to time/size policies regardless of consumption. Consumers track their own read offsets.
   - RabbitMQ: Traditional message broker based on AMQP. Messages are pushed to consumers and deleted upon acknowledgment (ephemeral).

2. Delivery Model:
   - Kafka: Pull-based model where consumers poll batches at their own pace, enabling massive horizontal scalability and log replayability.
   - RabbitMQ: Smart broker / dumb consumer push-based model with complex exchange routing (topic, fanout, headers, direct).

3. Throughput & Ordering:
   - Kafka: Millions of events/sec; strict total order guaranteed within each partition.
   - RabbitMQ: Tens of thousands of messages/sec; priority queueing, delayed messages, and per-message retry mechanisms.

Optimal Fit:
- Use Kafka for: High-throughput event streaming, event sourcing, CDC (change data capture), telemetry, and stream processing with Kafka Streams / Flink.
- Use RabbitMQ for: Granular routing, background job queues, request-reply RPCs, and per-message dead-letter acknowledgments.`,

    companyTags: ['Amazon', 'Cockroach Labs', 'Databricks'],
    techStack: ['PostgreSQL', 'MySQL InnoDB', 'ACID', 'Concurrency'],
    idealAnswer: `ANSI SQL defines 4 standard transaction isolation levels to balance concurrency against data consistency anomalies:

Anomalies:
1. Dirty Read: Transaction reads uncommitted modifications made by another transaction.
2. Non-repeatable (Fuzzy) Read: Re-reading a row retrieves altered values because another transaction committed an UPDATE.
3. Phantom Read: Re-executing a range query retrieves additional rows because another transaction committed an INSERT.
4. Serialization Anomaly: The final outcome of concurrent transactions cannot be reproduced by any serial order.

Isolation Levels:
- Read Uncommitted: Prevents nothing. Allows dirty reads. (Rarely used in production).
- Read Committed (Postgres/Oracle default): Prevents Dirty Reads via MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) snapshotting at statement start.
- Repeatable Read (MySQL default): Prevents Dirty and Non-repeatable Reads. Snapshot is taken at transaction start. In Postgres, also prevents Phantom Reads using MVCC.

- Write QPS: 100M / (30 days * 86400s) ≈ 40 writes/sec (Peak ~100 writes/sec).
- Read QPS: 10B / (30 days * 86400s) ≈ 4,000 reads/sec (Peak ~10,000 reads/sec). Read-heavy ratio (100:1).
- Storage: 7-character Base62 string (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) yields 62^7 ≈ 3.5 trillion unique combinations. At 500 bytes/record, 5 years storage is ~3 TB.

2. Ingress & Edge Redirection:
   - Cloudflare / AWS CloudFront CDN edge caches popular redirects with HTTP 301 (Permanent) or 302 (Found) for analytics capture.
   - API Gateway load balances requests across Stateless Redirect Microservices.
3. Caching & Storage:
   - Redis cluster caches hot 20% of URLs using LRU eviction (serves >95% of reads with sub-5ms latency).
   - Distributed Primary Datastore: Cassandra or DynamoDB partitioned by hash(short_key) for linear write scalability.
4. Analytics Pipeline:

    techStack: ['CRDT', 'OT', 'WebSockets', 'Concurrency', 'Vector Clocks'],
    idealAnswer: `Real-time collaborative editing requires reconciling concurrent, conflicting mutations from distributed clients over high-latency networks.

Core Concurrency Reconcilers:
1. Operational Transformation (OT) vs Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs):
   - OT (Google Docs): Requires a centralized server to sequence operations, transform incoming edits against concurrent operations, and broadcast transformed operations back to clients. Complex mathematically with N-way transformations.
   - CRDTs (Figma, Notion, Yjs, Automerge): Mathematically proven convergence without a centralized coordinator. Operations commute (order of receipt does not alter final state). Each character is assigned a unique, immutable fractional index and vector clock.

High-Level Architecture:
1. Client-Side:
   - Local CRDT document state with optimistic UI rendering.
   - Local edit queue handles offline edits; synchronizes seamlessly upon reconnect.
2. Communication Layer:
   - Full-duplex WebSocket connections multiplexed over geographically distributed edge servers (Anycast routing).
   - Sticky routing or hash ring based on document_id ensures editors of the same document terminate on the same coordinator room.
3. Persistence & Snapshotting:
   - Append-only log of CRDT operations stored in Redis Streams / Kafka.
   - Periodic snapshotting worker compresses historical mutations into document snapshots (S3 / PostgreSQL) every 100 operations or 30 seconds to bound memory and catch-up sync times.

    companyTags: ['OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'Scale AI', 'Databricks'],
    techStack: ['RAG', 'Vector DB', 'Embeddings', 'HyDE', 'Rerankers'],
    idealAnswer: `A robust enterprise RAG system requires multi-stage retrieval, semantic chunking, and precision reranking:

1. Ingestion & Semantic Chunking:
   - Replace fixed-token chunking with semantic, document-aware boundary chunking (splitting on markdown headers, table structures, and code blocks) with 10-15% chunk overlap.
   - Embed parent document chunks with smaller child retrieval windows (Parent Document Retrieval) so search matches granular sentences while the LLM receives full semantic context.
2. Hybrid Search (Dense + Sparse):
   - Combine dense semantic vector embeddings (OpenAI text-embedding-3 or BAAI/bge-large) with sparse lexical search (BM25 / Elasticsearch) using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). This ensures exact acronyms, part numbers, and error codes are found alongside semantic concepts.
3. Query Enhancement:
   - Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE): Generate a preliminary synthetic answer with LLM and embed that answer for retrieval.
   - Query decomposition: Break complex multi-part questions into distinct parallel search queries.
4. Two-Stage Reranking:
   - Retrieve top 50 candidates from vector DB, then pass through a cross-encoder reranker (e.g., Cohere Rerank or BGE-Reranker-Large) to score deep query-document relevance, narrowing down to the top 5 most relevant passages.
5. Grounding & Hallucination Guardrails:
   - Instruct the LLM with strict context-anchored prompting: "Cite specific passage IDs [Doc-X]. If the context does not contain the answer, explicitly state 'Insufficient information'".
   - Post-generation validation using secondary verification models or BLEU/ROUGE/faithfulness rubrics.`,

    difficulty: 'Senior',
    companyTags: ['NVIDIA', 'Meta', 'Hugging Face'],
    techStack: ['LLM Serving', 'Quantization', 'CUDA', 'vLLM', 'Ollama'],
    idealAnswer: `Quantization reduces the precision of model weights (and sometimes activations) from 32-bit floating point (FP32) or 16-bit (FP16/BF16) to lower-bit representations like 8-bit integers (INT8) or 4-bit integers (INT4).

Mathematical & Memory Impact:
- VRAM Calculation: A 70B parameter model in FP16 requires ~140 GB of GPU VRAM just to hold the weights (70B * 2 bytes). In 4-bit quantization (0.5 bytes/param), the footprint drops to ~35-40 GB, allowing it to fit onto a single consumer workstation or dual RTX 3090/4090s.
- Memory Bandwidth Bottleneck: LLM token generation (autoregressive decoding) is heavily memory-bandwidth bound rather than compute-bound. Transferring smaller quantized weights from VRAM to compute cores increases token generation speed significantly on memory-constrained systems.

Formats & Techniques:
1. GGUF: Binary format developed for llama.cpp/Ollama; allows CPU/GPU split offloading with quantization variants like Q4_K_M and Q8_0.
2. AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization): Identifies the top 1% salient weights that protect model quality and protects them from aggressive quantization, achieving near-lossless INT4 accuracy.

    idealAnswer: `STAR Structure:

- Situation: "Our team was architecting our next-generation customer reporting engine. A senior peer advocated for a complex distributed microservices architecture using Apache Flink and Kafka, whereas I believed our scale and roadmap were better served by leveraging our existing PostgreSQL read replicas with ClickHouse for OLAP."
- Task: "My goal was to prevent premature architectural overengineering and high maintenance overhead, while ensuring we hit our strict Q3 launch deadline without damaging team morale or professional trust."
- Action:
  1. Data-Driven Alignment: Rather than arguing philosophy, I proposed we write an RFC with concrete evaluation criteria: development velocity, operational maintenance cost, infrastructure expense, and our projected 3-year data volume.
  2. Timeboxed Spike: We paired on a 3-day proof-of-concept benchmark. I demonstrated that ClickHouse handled our 100M row analytics queries in <45ms at 1/5th the infrastructure complexity of managing a dedicated Flink cluster.
  3. Compromise & Respect: I incorporated his valuable concerns regarding future streaming ingestion by ensuring our schema design decoupled raw event streams, allowing an easy migration path to streaming if business scale demanded it later.
- Result: "The team unanimously adopted the ClickHouse RFC. We delivered the project two weeks ahead of schedule with zero operational incidents in production, and our collaborative relationship was strengthened, leading us to co-author subsequent architectural proposals together."`,
